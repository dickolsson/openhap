# $class->drop_privileges(%args):
#	Drop privileges from root to specified user and group.
#	This is a common pattern in OpenBSD daemons - start as root
#	to bind privileged ports and fork privileged processes,
#	then drop to unprivileged user for the main event loop.
#
#	%args:
#		user  => $username  # Username to drop to (required)
#		group => $groupname # Group to drop to (optional, defaults to user's primary group)
#
#	Returns 1 on success, dies on error.
#
#	Example:
#		# Start as root, do privileged operations
#		$mdns->register_service();  # Forks mdnsctl as root
#
#		# Drop privileges before entering event loop
#		FuguLib::Privdrop->drop_privileges(user => '_openhap');
#
#		# Now running as _openhap
#		$server->run();
