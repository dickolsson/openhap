    - [x] Shell scripts in `scripts/integration/` for VM management
    - [x] Documentation in `scripts/integration/README.md`

  - **What's needed to make integration tests work:**
    1. **Pre-built OpenBSD VM Image** (HIGH PRIORITY)
       - Current issue: OpenBSD installation requires interactive setup
       - Solution options: a. Create pre-installed OpenBSD QCOW2 image with
         OpenHAP
         - Boot official OpenBSD image
         - Complete unattended installation (using autoinstall(8))
         - Install OpenHAP and dependencies
         - Package as reusable QCOW2 image
         - Host on GitHub releases or CDN b. Use OpenBSD autoinstall feature
         - Create install.conf for unattended installation
         - Boot with -kernel/-initrd for automated setup
         - Provision OpenHAP post-install
       - Estimated time: 4-8 hours to create and test
       - Files needed:
         - `scripts/integration/build-openbsd-image.sh` - Build automation
         - `share/openhap/examples/install.conf` - Autoinstall configuration
         - GitHub release with pre-built image

    2. **Passwordless SSH Access** (HIGH PRIORITY)
       - Current issue: provision-vm.sh and run-integration-tests.sh need SSH
       - Solution options: a. Embed SSH public key in pre-built image
         - Add key to /root/.ssh/authorized_keys during image build
         - Generate ephemeral key pair in CI b. Use QEMU serial console instead
           of SSH
         - Send commands via QEMU monitor
         - More complex but avoids SSH dependency
       - Estimated time: 2-4 hours
       - Files to modify:
         - `scripts/integration/provision-vm.sh`
         - `scripts/integration/run-integration-tests.sh`
         - Add `scripts/integration/generate-ssh-key.sh`

    3. **GitHub Actions Runner Optimization** (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
       - Current issue: QEMU without KVM is slow
       - Solutions: a. Use ubuntu-latest (has KVM support via nested
         virtualization) b. Reduce VM memory/CPU requirements for CI c.
         Implement timeout protection (currently 30 min default) d. Cache
         pre-warmed VM disk snapshots
       - GitHub Actions specific settings:
         - Enable hardware acceleration if available
         - Use matrix strategy to parallelize tests
         - Add reasonable timeouts (job: 60min, VM boot: 10min)
       - Estimated time: 1-2 hours
       - Files to modify:
         - `.github/workflows/integration.yml` - Add KVM setup, caching
         - `scripts/integration/setup-vm.sh` - Optimize for CI environment

    4. **Automated Test Execution** (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
       - Current issue: Tests require running VM and services
       - Needed: a. Health check before running tests
         - Wait for SSH to be available
         - Wait for openhapd to start
         - Wait for port 51827 to listen
         - Implement retry logic with backoff b. Service startup validation
         - Verify mosquitto is running
         - Verify openhapd process exists
         - Check logs for startup errors c. Test result collection
         - Capture test output
         - Collect logs on failure
         - Generate test reports
       - Estimated time: 3-4 hours
       - Files to modify:
         - `scripts/integration/provision-vm.sh` - Add health checks
         - `scripts/integration/run-integration-tests.sh` - Better error
           handling
         - Add `scripts/integration/wait-for-service.sh` - Health check helper

    5. **Network Configuration** (LOW PRIORITY)
       - Current implementation: QEMU user networking (SLIRP)
       - Status: Currently working, but could be improved
       - Possible improvements: a. Use TAP networking for better performance b.
         Configure specific port ranges to avoid conflicts c. Add network
         isolation for security
       - Estimated time: 2-3 hours if needed
       - Files to modify:
         - `scripts/integration/setup-vm.sh` - Add TAP networking option

    6. **Test Environment Variables** (LOW PRIORITY)
       - Current: Many hardcoded defaults
       - Improvements needed:
         - Make all timeouts configurable
         - Allow custom OpenBSD mirror
         - Support air-gapped/offline testing
         - Add verbose/debug modes
       - Estimated time: 1-2 hours
       - Files to modify:
         - All `scripts/integration/*.sh` - Better env var support

  - **Implementation Steps for GitHub Actions:**

    **Phase 1: Create Pre-built Image (Required for CI)**

    ```bash
    # 1. Create automated OpenBSD installation script
    scripts/integration/build-openbsd-image.sh

    # 2. Build image locally
    make integration-build-image

    # 3. Test image boots and runs OpenHAP
    make integration-test-image

    # 4. Upload to GitHub releases
    gh release create v1.0-openbsd-image openbsd-75-openhap.qcow2.gz

    # 5. Update download-openbsd-image.sh to fetch pre-built image
    ```

    **Phase 2: Enable SSH Access**

    ```bash
    # 1. Generate SSH key pair in CI
    - name: Generate SSH key
      run: |
        ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f ~/.ssh/openhap_test -N ""
        echo "SSH_PRIVATE_KEY=$(cat ~/.ssh/openhap_test)" >> $GITHUB_ENV

    # 2. Pre-built image includes corresponding public key
    # 3. Update provision-vm.sh to use key-based auth
    ```

    **Phase 3: Update GitHub Actions Workflow**

    ```yaml
    # Note: .github/workflows/integration.yml does not yet exist
    # Will need to create when pre-built image is ready
    # Add to workflow:
    - name: Enable KVM
      run: |
        # Check if KVM is available
        if [ -e /dev/kvm ]; then
          echo "KVM is available"
          sudo chmod 666 /dev/kvm
        else
          echo "KVM not available, using TCG emulation"
        fi

    - name: Cache OpenBSD VM image
      uses: actions/cache@v3
      with:
        path: ~/.cache/openhap-integration
        key: openbsd-vm-${{ matrix.openbsd_version }}-v1

    - name: Run integration tests
      timeout-minutes: 30
      run: make integration
    ```

    **Phase 4: Testing and Validation**

    ```bash
    # 1. Test locally first
    make integration

    # 2. Test in act (local GitHub Actions runner)
    act -j integration-test

    # 3. Create PR and verify in GitHub Actions
    # 4. Monitor timing and adjust timeouts
    # 5. Verify test results and logs
    ```

  - **Alternative: Minimal Integration Tests Without Full VM**

    If building a full VM proves too complex, consider:
    1. **Mock Integration Tests** (Quick win)
       - Run OpenHAP in foreground on GitHub Actions runner
       - Use local mosquitto
       - Test basic API without actual pairing
       - Estimated time: 2-3 hours

    2. **Container-based Testing** (Alternative approach)
       - Use OpenBSD container (if available)
       - Or use Linux with OpenHAP
       - Less authentic but easier to automate
       - Estimated time: 3-4 hours
