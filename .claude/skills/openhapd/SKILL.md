  Run and debug the openhapd daemon during development. Use when running the
  daemon in the foreground, validating a configuration file, or debugging
  startup, logging, or mDNS registration problems.

# Run and Debug the Daemon

## Objective

Run `bin/openhapd` against a development configuration and diagnose startup or
runtime problems.

## Workflow

1. Validate the configuration without starting:

   ```sh
   bin/openhapd -n -c /path/to/openhapd.conf
   ```

2. Run in the foreground with debug logging (logs to stderr instead of syslog):

   ```sh
   bin/openhapd -f -v -c /path/to/openhapd.conf
   ```

3. In the test VM, run it as the real service and watch syslog:

   ```sh
   bin/openhvf ssh 'rcctl restart openhapd'
   bin/openhvf ssh 'tail -f /var/log/daemon'
   ```

## Debugging notes

- Startup ordering in `bin/openhapd` is delicate: it chowns `/var/db/openhapd`,
  drops to `_openhap`, then re-initializes logging and registers mDNS. Symptoms
  like silent syslog or missing mDNS advertisements usually trace back to
  changes in this order.
- Use the `hapctl` skill to inspect a running installation.
