description:
  Operate the openhvf QEMU VM harness used for OpenBSD integration testing:
  bring the VM up or down, provision it, run commands over SSH, watch logs,
  and troubleshoot. Use when starting, provisioning, debugging, or scripting
  the test VM, or when an openhvf command fails.

# Operate the Test VM

## Objective

Drive the OpenBSD test VM with `bin/openhvf` during development: lifecycle,
provisioning, ad-hoc commands, and troubleshooting.

## Workflow

1. Bring the VM up and wait until it accepts SSH:

   ```sh
   make vm-up                      # idempotent; wraps openhvf up + wait
   ```

   or directly:

   ```sh
   bin/openhvf up && bin/openhvf wait --timeout=300
   ```

2. Install the current tree into the VM (build, copy, `make install`, enable
   services):

   ```sh
   make vm-provision
   ```

3. Run ad-hoc commands in the VM:

   ```sh
   bin/openhvf ssh 'rcctl restart openhapd'
   bin/openhvf ssh 'tail -f /var/log/daemon'
   bin/openhvf ssh 'uname -a'
   ```

4. For scripted console interaction (no SSH yet), run an expect script:

   ```sh
   bin/openhvf expect share/openhvf/expect/command.exp
   ```

## Troubleshooting

- `openhvf status` prints the VM state, `ssh_port`, and `console_port`.
- "Not in an OpenHVF project" — run from the repo root (the project is
  auto-discovered via `.openhvfrc`) or pass `--project`.
- SSH failures after an unclean shutdown — `bin/openhvf disk check`, then
  `bin/openhvf disk repair` with the VM stopped.
- Start over from a clean slate: `bin/openhvf destroy && make vm-provision`
  (destroy deletes the disk image; the cached installation image is kept).
- On aarch64 hosts without hardware acceleration, pass `--emulate`.
